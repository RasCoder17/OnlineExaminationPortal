# OnlineExaminationPortal
In this project, we are going to create an Online Examination portal.  It will contain a login for students and a login for Admins/Professors. A student/Admin can log in with their username and password, and if they don’t have an account then they can sign up. After logging in, the students can attempt MCQ tests, and can see their score after the test gets over. If the student is new and does not have an account yet, then they have the option of signing up. After logging in, the admins can add, update, or delete questions. They can also view the scores of the students who have attempted the test.

Online Examination System is considered to be one of the fastest ways to conduct tests and have them graded. Online Exam Management System (OEMS) supports secure login and it also allows the students to attend MCQ (Multiple choice questions) tests. After the exam, the student’s answers are evaluated by OEMS. In this way it proves to be quite efficient. Admins can log in, add, delete or update questions. The Online Examination System does not allow the student to attempt the test after the allotted time is over. This system helps the educational institutions to monitor the students who are attending the test until the expiration of the allowed time. Using Online Examination System, students can create an account for test-related purposes. After attempting the test, the marks scored by the student will immediately be displayed on the screen. Admins can login and see the marks scored by the students.

We are developing an advanced online examination portal that caters to both students and administrators. This platform allows users to log in to their respective accounts, and if they don't have an account yet, they can easily create one. Students will have the opportunity to attempt tests and access their scores upon completion. Meanwhile, administrators will have the privilege to manage the test content by adding, updating, or deleting questions.

Key features of our online examination portal include:

User Accounts: Students and administrators can log in to their dedicated accounts using secure credentials. New users can create accounts easily, providing a seamless experience for everyone.

Test Management: Administrators will have exclusive access to the test management functionality. They can add new questions to the test, update existing questions, or remove questions as needed. This ensures the content remains relevant and up-to-date.

Automated Test Timer: Each test will have a predefined time limit, and the system will automatically close the test when the timer runs out. This feature encourages students to complete the test within the allocated time, providing a fair assessment environment.

Test Attempt and Score: Students can attempt the tests assigned to them, answering the questions within the given time frame. Upon completion, they will instantly receive their scores, allowing them to evaluate their performance in real-time.

User-Friendly Interface: Our platform offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both students and administrators to navigate through the portal effortlessly.

By combining these features, our online examination portal provides a robust and efficient solution for conducting exams in a digital environment. It streamlines the examination process, ensures secure access, and provides prompt results to enhance the overall learning experience for students and administrators alike.
