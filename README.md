# OnlineExaminationPortal
In this project, we are going to create an Online Examination portal.  It will contain a login for students and a login for Admins/Professors. A student/Admin can log in with their username and password, and if they donâ€™t have an account then they can sign up. After logging in, the students can attempt MCQ tests, and can see their score after the test gets over. If the student is new and does not have an account yet, then they have the option of signing up. After logging in, the admins can add, update, or delete questions. They can also view the scores of the students who have attempted the test.
